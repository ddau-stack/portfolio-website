# Personal website
A website I made in HTML and CSS for my final assignment for my web design and development course.

## Dependencies
There are no required dependencies to run this project.

## To run
Open the HTML file with the browser of your choice.

## Issues
One of the divs will go to the wrong location when the browser size is just smaller than the monitor size. The website still works as expected when the browser shrinks to the dimensions for the responsive website.
